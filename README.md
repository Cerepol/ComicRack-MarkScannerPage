This script will mark a scanner page as pageType Deleted by default (that can be changed by editing MarkScannerPage.py)

Shows progress and update log using the wonderful work done by docdoom and T3KNOGHO57 from the ComicRack for the progress form and the log display.
Now will also properly work when done for ComicRacks using database (instead of embedded xml) and no longer needs the pages to be populated before then (by opening Info -> Pages)

So I recommend installing Stonepaw's Books with Pages Marked plugin (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16I10_Mur6v1EzDm9GKUSgl89cowknnHS) to display comics after the scanner page has been marked. It can then be deleted using CR if you so choose.

The logic for this plugin was copied from comicTagger. CT had a routine to find the page, but wasn't exposing that as an easy option.
